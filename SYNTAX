== Base syntax

[moo]  quote
'moo   single-quote (equivalent)
other  word

== Word lookup

If the word is not in the hash-table, some hooks are set to 
detect: fixnum, float, .. (other ?)

Micro-macros could be implemented, for example for units ? 10px => Pixel.new(10)

== Core words

The idea is to create a minimal subset of words that can implement the other words. The definitive list is not yet
defined. (line nand is usable to build all other logic)
